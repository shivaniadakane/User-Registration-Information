# User-Registration-Information
This repository provides a comprehensive demonstration of a SQL task, presenting both SQL script queries and Python code for managing a 'Registration' table. This includes the creation of the table and the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

 Task Overview
1. SQL Table Creation: 
The sql/ directory contains the SQL script for creating the 'Registration' table. The script, create_table.sql, defines the structure of the table, including fields such as ID, Name, Email, Date of Birth and additional customizable fields.

2. CRUD Operations Implementation (Python): 
The srcipt / directory houses the Python code for CRUD operations. The main script, main.ipynb, includes functions for creating, reading, updating and deleting records in the 'Registration' table.

 CRUD Operations: 
The main script, main.py, houses the implementation of CRUD operations for the 'Registration' table. Functions include:

Create: Adds a new record to the 'Registration' table.

Read: Retrieves a record based on the provided ID.

Update: Modifies an existing record in the 'Registration' table.

Delete: Removes a record from the 'Registration' table.
